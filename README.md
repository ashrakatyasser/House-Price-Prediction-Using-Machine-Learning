# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting **house prices** using machine learning models. By analyzing housing data, the project demonstrates how different algorithms can estimate housing prices based on multiple features.  

The goal is to provide insights and accurate predictions that can help **buyers, sellers, and real estate investors** make informed decisions.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes various features that influence housing prices, such as:  
- Crime rate per town  
- Average number of rooms per dwelling  
- Distance to employment centers  
- Property tax rate  
- Pupil-teacher ratio  
- Accessibility to highways  
- And other socio-economic and geographical indicators

## ⚙️ Project Workflow  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Handle missing values  
- Encode categorical variables (if any)  
- Apply feature scaling  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Analyze feature distributions  
- Visualize correlations between variables  
- Identify most influential features  

### 3. Model Training & Evaluation  
- Train multiple models:  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- Evaluate model performance using:  
  - **R² Score**  

### 4. Model Selection  
- Compare models based on performance metrics  
- Select the best-performing model for predictions  

### 5. Predictions  
- Generate house price predictions on test data
